Sometimes our community creates something so perfect, we have to share it with everyone. Today's spotlight goes to @PawneeForever for their absolutely brilliant "Parks and Rec: The Glow-Up" subset.

## What Makes This Subset Special

Instead of just picking the "best" episodes, @PawneeForever crafted a narrative that shows the show's incredible transformation from Season 1's awkward Office-clone to the heartwarming comedy masterpiece we all love.

### The Genius Selection:

**Season 1, Episode 6: "Rock Show"** - The first glimpse of the show's true potential
**Season 2, Episode 13: "The Set Up"** - Where the show finds its voice
**Season 3, Episode 13: "The Fight"** - Peak comedy chaos
**Season 4, Episode 22: "Win, Lose or Draw"** - The emotional payoff
**Season 6, Episode 12: "Farmers Market"** - The perfect farewell tour

## Why We Love It

This subset doesn't just showcase great episodesâ€”it tells the story of a show learning to be itself. You can literally watch Parks and Rec discover its heart, and that's something special.

The community response has been incredible, with over 200 people adding this to their watchlists in just one week.
